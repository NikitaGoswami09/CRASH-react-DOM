    // Reflection: React's approach offers a more declarative way to create UI elements compared to traditional DOM manipulation. With React, you define what you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM efficiently. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code and better performance, especially in complex applications. Additionally, React's virtual DOM allows it to optimize updates by only re-rendering components that have changed, reducing the need for manual optimization and making development smoother.
